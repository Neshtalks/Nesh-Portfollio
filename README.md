## Setup and Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Nesh-Portfolio.git
    cd Nesh-Portfolio
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
    *   For the service worker to function correctly, you might need to serve the files using a local web server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code, Python's `http.server`, or `npx serve`).

3.  **Resume:**
    *   Create a folder named `resume` in the project's root directory.
    *   Place your resume PDF file (e.g., `Dinesh_Krishnamoorthy_Resume.pdf`) inside the `resume` folder.
    *   Update the link in `index.html` if your filename is different.

## Customization

*   **Content:** Update `index.html` with your personal information, experience, projects, etc.
*   **Styling:** Modify `style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout.
*   **Images:** Replace placeholder images in the `images/` folder.
*   **Social Links:** Update the placeholder URLs in `index.html` for LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X.
*   **Contact Form:** For a functional contact form, integrate a service like [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/), or set up your own backend.
